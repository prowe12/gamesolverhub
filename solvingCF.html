        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Connect Four is a fairly common 2-player board game. Opponents take turns dropping
            a colored tile into a grid with 6 rows and 7 columns. The first player to get four tiles
            in a row, either horizontally, vertically, ascending, or descending, wins. This means that each move,
            each player has to act in a way that maximizes their chance to get four tiles in a row, while
            also minimizing their opponents chance to get four tiles in a row. The game ends when one of the players 
            has one, or when there are no possible moves left to make (each column is completely filled with tiles).
        </p>

        <h2>The Computer Player</h2>
        <p>
            On this website, you will play against the computer. You may notice that if you set the depth at 0,
            the computer is easy to beat. However, if you ramp up the depth to 4, it is very difficult
            to catch the computer off guard. This is because the computer is using the minimax algorithm to determine its next move.
            <br>
            If you would like to see how the computer is using minimax for the current game, set the 
            depth to 2 or under and click "show minimax walkthrough" on the game page.
        </p>

        <h3>Minimax Algorithm</h3>
        <p>  Once The minimax tree has reached the passed in depth level, 
            it uses an evaluation heuristic to measure the current score on the board. 
            The min value wants to make a move that minimizes this value, and the max
            value wants to make a move that maxmimzes this value.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluation Heuristic</h3>
        <p>The evaluation heuristic is used to measure the current score on the board.
            Since the algorithm is playing for the computer, the human player (red) will
            receive negative points and the computer player (yellow) will receive positive points.
        </p>
         <p>
            The heuristic moves through each area on the board where there could be four tiles in a row.
            It starts by moving through each row and measuring each set of four tiles.
            It then moves through each column and measures each set of four tiles.
            It then looks at all ascending runs and measures each set of four tiles.
            It then looks at all descending runs and measures each set of four tiles.
            Each set of tiles gets points based on the following criteria:
            <br>
            <br>
            If there are tiles from both players (red and yellow), no points are gained. 
            This is because there is no room for either player to win the game by placing four tiles in a row.
            The following rules assume there are only tiles from one player.
            <br>
            <br>
            If there is one tile for the player, the player receives a score of 1 or -1.
            <br>
            <br>
            if there are two tiles for the player, the player receives a score of 10 or -10.
            <br>
            <br>
            If there are three tiles for the player, the player receives a score of 100 or -100.
            <br>
            <br>
            If there are four tiles for the player, the player receives a score of 1000 or -1000.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the heuristic evaluates the board, it sums the score that it finds in each set of tiles
            and returns the total score. The human player seeks the board with the maximum negative score, and the 
            computer player seeks the board with the maximum positive score.
